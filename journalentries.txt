HOW TO SURVIVE THE WILDS WITH CASH AND YOUR WITS: 

04/20/1969: 
Holy shit! I can't believe they didn't notice all that cash missing from the federal reserve... I am a BAMF! I'm going to start a cash-stash (I crack myself up) 
at the bottom of the ocean near some mines I've been to before. They're out of the way, and 
the mines are always fun on shrooms...Oh! and remember to get out of the mine's just knock off a miner and steal his pickaxe.

Well, that could've gone better. Switching from shrooms to codeine didn't do me a damn bit of good because I forgot the bomb this time.
The waitress was really confused... so was I because I thought I was in a Well's Fargo (I was in  Wendy's). 
But, I still got a little bit of cash to put away. Maybe I'll switch back to psychedelics as my DOC...Note to self: stop doing year-long drug binges.

Nope. Cocaine. All around cocaine this year. I think this is the last heist, ole journal old buddy. 
This year has been the ride of my life! But, I want to start a parachuting business called "Fly the Coop".

Manic TO-DO List: 
1) Remember the bomb this time. 
2) Get $200, 000. 
3) Test out parachute prototype for new business idea!
