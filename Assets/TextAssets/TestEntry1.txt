5/16/1969:
Waves crash on the beach as I watch the sunrise. It reminds me of the constant struggle of the working stiff. 
They beat the shore into sand all day and night and for what? No reward. Nothing but the unspoken invitation
to keep doing it for eternity. Well, that's the life for suckers! Got fired from the mine yessterday. 
Had a few drinks about it and went back to the caves after the last shift. Found an amazing spot to hide some dough whenever I do end up 
putting together a big score... But first you have to find the cave entrance to the ocean.
