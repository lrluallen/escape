Haha! Yesterday was a real rush! Plan went off without a hitch (except I missed the drop zone and had to hitchhike to
Olympia where I'd left the car). Otherwise, flawless! Those big wigs didn't know what to think when I jumped outta the plane with
that $200,000. What's better is they'll never think to look in the ocean near some rando cave in the woods! Not to yank my own ripcord or anything, 
but I think they'll be trying to solve this one for quite a while...
