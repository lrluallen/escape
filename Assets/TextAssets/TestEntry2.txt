7/22/1970:
I got a lot of ideas brewing. Just need to throw together some chump change for 
"travel expenses". I was able to lift a crate of dynamite from the last shipment to the mine.
I stashed it at one of the dead tunnels in the lowest level of the mine. Now I have everything
I need for my stash spot except the stash itself...
