Ha! No one will ever get their hands on my stash but me!
In my infinite wisdom, I hid my stash in a treasure chest,
(all piratey and cool, am I right?) and then broke the key!
Now the only way to get into that chest is to find the pieces and
rebuild the key! But there's only one place the key can be built,
and I will take that info to the grave!!!
(which is definitely a grave I will not be going to anytime soon)
HAHA! I really am too good...
That last hijacking went so well,
I think I'll be hitting a Boeing 727 tomorrow for the same amount as well!!!
What could go wrong?
